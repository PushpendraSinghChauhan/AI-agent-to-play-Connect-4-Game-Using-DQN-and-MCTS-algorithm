# AI-agent-to-play-Connect-4-Game-Using-DQN-(Deep-Q-Learning)-and-MCTS-algorithm
Used Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm and DQN (Deep Q Learning) algorithm of Reinforcement Learning to build an AI agent which can play Connect 4 game automatically against predefined agents (i.e. 'random' and 'negamax') in Kaggle's ConnectX environment as well as against human player also.
